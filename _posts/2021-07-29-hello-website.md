This is the first website I've made since the late 90's when I made one on
Geocities (before they were bought by Yahoo), haha! It's nice to see how much 
things have changed since then in the world of web development. 

Shout out to [Artem Sheludko](https://github.com/artemsheludko) for providing 
the beautiful base template for this website for free -- so I can spend less 
time on web development, and more time on software development!

Now that I have a place to deploy some of my applications, let's get to it!
