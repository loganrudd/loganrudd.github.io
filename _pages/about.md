My name is Logan Rudd. I am a machine learning engineer with a background in 
physics instrumentation R&D in the fields of space exploration, accelerator
physics, and particle astrophysics. Originally from Phoenix, AZ, I have lived 
in Los Angeles, the SF east bay, and currently in Guadalajara, Mexico. When I'm
not busy with work, and personal tech projects, I like to spend my time playing
with my dog and exercising (calisthenics, running, climbing, and mountain 
biking) outdoors as much as possible.
