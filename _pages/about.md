My name is Logan Rudd. I am a physicist turned developer with a passion in
creating ML applications. Originally from Phoenix, AZ, I have
lived in Los Angeles, the SF east bay, and currently in Guadalajara, Mexico.
When I'm not busy inside with work, and personal tech projects, I like to spend
my time playing with my dog and exercising (calisthenics, running, climbing, 
and mountain biking) outdoors as much as possible.
